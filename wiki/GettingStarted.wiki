#summary Getting started with apt-cyg

= Introduction =

This page provides quick help to get you started using apt-cyg.


= Step-by-step =

  * You will need to install Cygwin using conventional methods because apt-cyg is just a script and it requires quite a bit of standard Unix before it will run.
  * This is a very lightweight project, meaning, among other things, _no releases_.  When you want to install apt-cyg, just check it out from the Subversion repository.
  * If you checked it out read-only using Google's instructions, rename it to the canonical name, move it to a bin folder, and make it executable.  Here's one method:

{{{
  # mkdir -p ~/bin
  # mv apt-cyg-read-only ~/bin/apt-cyg
  # chmod +x ~/bin/apt-cyg
  # PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  # export PATH
}}}
