#summary Getting started with apt-cyg

= Introduction =

This page provides quick help to get you started using apt-cyg.


= Step-by-step =

  * You will need to install Cygwin using conventional methods because apt-cyg is just a script and it requires quite a bit of standard Unix before it will run.
  * This is a very lightweight project, meaning, among other things, _no releases_.  When you want to install apt-cyg, just check it out from the Subversion repository:

{{{
  # for developers:
  # svn checkout https://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ apt-cyg --username <user>

  # for users:
  # svn checkout http://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ apt-cyg
}}}

  * Move it to a bin folder, and make it executable.  Here's one method:

{{{
  # mkdir -p ~/bin
  # mv apt-cyg/apt-cyg ~/bin/apt-cyg
  # chmod +x ~/bin/apt-cyg
  # PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  # export PATH
}}}

  * use apt-cyg, for example:

{{{
  # apt-cyg install nano
}}}

  * If you followed these instructions exactly by putting apt-cyg in your personal bin folder, modify your .profile or .bash_profile so your personal bin folder will be added to the PATH variable on startup...
